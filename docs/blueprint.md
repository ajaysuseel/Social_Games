# **App Name**: Sensory Social Games

## Core Features:

- Sensory Customization: Offers toggles for sound/animations and options for pastel/dark mode, minimizing visual clutter to ensure a sensory-safe environment.
- Predictable Structure: Displays clear visual progress indicators (e.g., 'Step 1/3') and fixed routines with verbal/visual warnings before changes to ensure a predictable game structure.
- Customizable Elements: Includes customization options for characters (animals, vehicles, abstract), rewards (stars, quiet chime, simple animation), and themes (space, ocean, farm) to increase engagement.
- Character Design Tool: Employs an AI tool to create a range of non-scary animal characters with neutral expressions for use within the games, adjustable based on the selected game and user preferences.
- Sound Design Tool: Integrates an AI tool that generates calming sounds for correct responses, ensuring frequencies remain under 500Hz to avoid sensory overload, based on selected themes or activities.
- Interaction Focus: Presents mechanics focused on a single interaction skill (turn-taking, joint attention, emotion mirroring) with low verbal demands, utilizing icons and sounds rather than text.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to promote calmness and reduce visual stimulation.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0) for minimal contrast and reduced visual stress.
- Accent color: Pale yellow (#FAF884) to gently draw attention without overwhelming.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to maximize readability and maintain a modern yet warm appearance.
- Uses simplified, universally understandable icons without complex details to support interaction.
- Applies subtle, non-distracting animations to provide visual feedback without overstimulation.
